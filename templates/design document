Game name: Gotchya
- What are the rules to the game?
This game is inspired by Connect 4, yet it has its own twists. The game consists of a 6 X 7 grid. Each player has their own coins to place into the grid. The first player to get 4 in a row vertical, horizontal, or diagonal wins.


- How is it played, is there a dice roll or some other action?
Players place their coin on the grid. 


- How are the player pieces visually identified?
Player 1 has pink coins and Player 2, the computer, has blue coins.


- What other elements are in the game?
If one player surrounds the other player’s coin on two sides, they automatically steal that coin and it turns into the surrounding player’s color. 


- What input from the user would you need to make the game go?
Player can type in their name at the start of the game and once they enter their name they can begin the name and place their first coin.
